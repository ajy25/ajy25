### About me

**Hi! I'm Andrew, a student at Brown University studying applied math and computer science.** My research interests fall within the realms of biostatistics and computational biology. I am passionate about leveraging data to improve medicine and healthcare. 

**Currently...**
- I am an intern at Regeneron. I train machine learning model for various research and business decision-making purposes.
- I am a student researcher in the Department of Biostatistics at Brown University. I am researching statistical and computational methods for analyzing spatial transcriptomics data.

**Previously...**
- I was a quantitative biology NSF REU research fellow at Northwestern University working on differential expression analysis of transposons in _C. elegans_. I also investigated image segmentation and conformal mapping techniques for the rapid analysis of _C. elegans_ images. 

**Additionally...**
- I am actively involved in teaching at Brown University:
  - HTA, Machine Learning - Spring 2025
  - HTA, Computational Probability & Statistics - Fall 2024
  - TA, Machine Learning - Spring 2024
  - TA, Statistical Inference - Spring 2024
  - TA, Computational Probability & Statistics - Fall 2023
