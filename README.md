### About me

**Hi! I'm Andrew, a third year undergraduate student at Brown University studying Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.** My research interests fall within the realms of statistics, machine learning, and computational biologyâ€”I am passionate about leveraging data to improve medicine and healthcare. 

**Currently...**
- I am a research intern at Regeneron. I develop machine learning models to predict patient outcomes for AI-powered clinical trials. 
- I am a student researcher for the Department of Biostatistics at Brown University. I am researching machine learning algorithms for a variety of inference tasks for spatial transcriptomics data. 

**Previously...**
- I was a student researcher at the NSF-Simons Center for Quantitative Biology. I investigated image segmentation and conformal mapping techniques for the rapid analysis of _C. elegans_ images. 
- I was a quantitative biology NSF REU research fellow at Northwestern University where I worked on differential expression analysis of transposons in _C. elegans_.

**Additionally...**
- I am actively involved in teaching at Brown University:
  - TA, Machine Learning - Spring 2024
  - TA, Statistical Inference - Spring 2024
  - TA, Computational Probability & Statistics - Fall 2023
  - Tutor, Statistical Inference - Spring 2023, Fall 2022

I'd love to get in touch! My email is [a_yang@brown.edu](a_yang@brown.edu).
